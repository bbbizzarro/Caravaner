Today's Goal: 
	I can set an active item with the number keys
	When I click on the world I should see which qualities I need to interact
	I should be able to clearly distinguish interactable tiles.

	- Locations where you can buy maps for the neighboring regions
	- Towns with 3 buy options. Clicking on inventory sells item.
	- Regions with name displaying
	- Tile Object pooling/batch draws (create separate world renderer class)
		- Move exported data to game. Pass data to world constructor
		- switch back to subdivision method!
	- editor tools
	- towns and trade routes
	- Simple simulator -> plant growth cycle?
	- Player-Object interaction
		- Need-fulfillment
	- Inventories
	X Create setup procedures for new game
	X Make deserialization generic

NOTES:

World
	Tile({data})

Game(SaveFile->World)
	Simulator(World)
		SimulatorSystem
	WorldRenderer(World)

Sunless Seas/Skies style game with embarking and disembarking and discrete story points. Goal is to get across the map?
The point is simulation not generation, the game is about trade routes.
